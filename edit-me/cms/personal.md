Full stack web developer and entrepreneur with 15+ years of professional experience and a passion for open source software, web technologies, usability and accessibility.

I’ve worked as a contractor, as an independent and also as a software development company owner. I’ve had the opportunity to be a part of projects of all sizes including large scale government projects for some of the largest organizations in Colombia such as Ministerio de Cultura, Federación Nacional de Cafeteros, Banco de la República and others.

I'm currently working at the technology vertical for the largest advertising agency in the world, Publicis Groupe. I enjoy developing projects with big social impacts like the Open Library for Colombia’s Peace Process ([BAPP.com.co](https://bapp.com.co)) and the 45 Salón Nacional de Artistas. ([45sna.com](https://45sna.com)).

I am a highly motivated, self-taught professional who thrives on problem-solving and continually seeks to expand my knowledge of cutting-edge technologies in the FOSS ecosystem.
