Full stack web developer and entrepreneur with 12+ years of professional experience and a passion for open source software, web technologies, usability and accessibility.

I’ve worked as a contractor, as an independent and also as a software development company owner. I’ve had the opportunity to be a part of projects of all sizes including large scale government projects for some of the largest organizations in Colombia such as Ministerio de Cultura, Federación Nacional de Cafeteros, Banco de la República and others.

Recently I’ve been focused on developing projects with big social impacts like the Open Library for Colombia’s Peace Process ([BAPP.com.co](https://bapp.com.co)) and the 45 Salón Nacional de artistas. ([45sna.com](https://45sna.com)) I’m self taught due to my curiosity and passion, I love problem solving and I’m always learning and reading about cutting edge technologies in FOSS.
