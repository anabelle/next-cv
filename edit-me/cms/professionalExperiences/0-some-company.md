As the lead web developer at La Cápsula I had the opportunity to work on challenging projects such as developing a 24/7 music streaming service at Radio Cápsula. As well as high impact projects for companies like dynamo.net and its several movies and Universidad Politécnico Gran Colombiano among others. Always pushing the boundaries of what was possible with web technologies at the time and striving for high quality results for our clients.
